Car-sharing is becoming a more and more popular green alternative to owning a car. I have created a program that manages a car-sharing service allowing companies to rent out their cars and find customers.

When you start the program, you are greeted by the main menu:

Next, you choose whether to log in as a manager or as a client, if manager is selected you will see the following menu:

You can display a list of all created companies or create a new one. Let's create a new one:

If you have chosen to log in as a client, you will see this:

So let's move on to creating a new user

The user has been created, let's finally log in!
After logging into the user account, we see this:

We are offered to rent a car, let's try it!

We forgot to add cars to the company, let's go back and fix it.

Let's go back to the user menu and try again

We rented a car. We can view the information about the rented car at any time now and we can always return the car

Enjoy using it! :)
